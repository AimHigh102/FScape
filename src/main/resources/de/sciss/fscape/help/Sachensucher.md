<BLOCKQUOTE>Let's see how non-soundfiles sound...</BLOCKQUOTE>

This takes any input file and tries to spot what kind of sample data it could be (tries to find &quot;wordlengths&quot; and sample encoding (integer or float)). i'm not sure about the &quot;windowlength&quot; but i think that's the minimum length for analyzing the most probable &quot;sample format&quot;. also not sure about the &quot;headroom&quot;, maybe a volume factor.

Sometimes there are nice results from uncompressed images and uncompressed movies.
