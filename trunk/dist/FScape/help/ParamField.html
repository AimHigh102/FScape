Most numeric parameters are entered using the ParamField gadgets. They consist of a
dial wheel, a number field and a unit display or gadget.

<p>&nbsp;<p>Numeric parameters can be entered either with the mouse or the keyboard. Use the
mouse to turn the dial wheel around - clockwise increases the value, counter clockwise decreases.
Single clicks or shift-clicks increase or decrease the value stepwise. Alt+click resets the value
(usually to zero). Try to get used to the acceleration function of the wheel turning, it's a bit
tricky. When you enter values with the keyboard they are immediately fit into a "parameter space",
i.e. are set back to a minimum or maximum value when exceeding certain limits. Deleting characters
is sometimes tricky. Try to mark the whole text and overwrite it.<p>
Next to the number field you see a unit field, either as a fixed label or a choice gadget.
In the latter case you can switch between different units, e.g. between Hertz and semitones or
percentage. Some units are relative units, e.g. semitones or percentages. In most cases it should
be clear to what basis the value relates. For example, in the <A HREF="ResampleDlg.html">resampling
module</A> the "new rate" field relates to the original sampling rate of the input file. When you
choose 44.1 kHz input and set "new rate" to +12 semitones, it means your output gets resampled to
88.2 kHz. Likewise switching the unit to "± %" translates the value to +100 %. Units starting with
a "±" indicate offsets. E.g. when 44.1 kHz is the reference and 1000 ±Hz is the "new rate" then the
destination rate will be 44.2 kHz.
<p>Whenever FScape
cannot find a reference value the number field entry remains unchanged though it's meaning may
change, of course.<p>When your text cursor is in a number field, hitting the F1 key brings up the
<A HREF="ParamSettingsDlg.html">global scale settings dialog</A>. Here you can change the number
of semitones per octave and the BPM rate that influence how the units "semi" and "beats" are
translated to Hertz and milliseconds resp.

<B>Known bugs:</B> None<p>
<B>To be done:</B> Reprogram the dial wheel, better usability. Allow user to change the
value resolution.<p>
